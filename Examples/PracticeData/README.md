# **Vignettes 1-4:**  
Vignettes 1-4 use data(labeled PracticeData) from the Covid19 PVI Dashboard located within the NIH. The following demos use the new Model 12.4 with the data being current for June 24,2021. Under this model, risk components are split into four domains: Infection Rate, Population Concentration, Intervention Measures, and Health & Environment. Overall, these four domains are comprised of a total of fourteen categories displayed in the figure below, each with their correspondiong weight shown. This new model, unlike previous models, accounts for vaccine data within Intervention Measures, thus allowing for a more accurate representation of COVID19 risk. More information about the model, including underlying components for each slice category, can be found at the NIH [PVI Dashboard details page](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/coronavirus/covid19pvi/details/).

Although the demos use Model 12.4, these methods are compatible with any results file produced by the ToxPi GUI. Current results files for the PVI Dashboard can be found at the [PVI Dashboard data repository](https://github.com/COVID19PVI/data) which can be used in place of the practice files, or custom made results using the ToxPi GUI can be used.   

# **Vignette 5:**  
Vignette 5 uses data from the paper <insert Kalie's paper info here when finalized and the data is added>.
