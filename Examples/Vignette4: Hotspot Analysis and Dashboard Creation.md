# **Vignette 4: Hot Spot Analysis Demonstration and Dashbaord Creation Using COVID-19 Data**  
Vignette 4 is a demonstration of one of the many analysis methods that can be done via integrating the ToxPi\*GIS Toolkit with existing ArcGIS methods. It uses hot spot analysis on the results of Vignette 3 with the full dataset to display high and low risk clusters for COVID-19 throughout the United States. The results are displayed in a Dashboard to demonstrate the hosting and extended visualization capablities that ArcGIS provides. The resulting dashboard can be found [here](https://ncsu.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=1518637a0b454036a3d0d2fc8239ff08). The practice data used in this demonstration was already processed through steps 1A and 1B and can be found [here](https://github.com/Jonathon-Fleming/ToxPi-GIS/tree/main/Examples/Practice%20Data). A further description of the data can be found [here](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/coronavirus/covid19pvi/details/).
